It is often seen as something good, but is this always so? As Christians, how do we determine whether a technology is morally acceptable? What guidelines do we follow when considering technology? This article explores these questions in order to provide some wisdom for approaching progress in technology from a Christian perspective.\nEvaluating Technology Through Biblical Principles As believers who desire to be conformed to Christ (Romans 8:29), we are called to live our lives according to the principles found in Scripture. Applying biblical wisdom helps us discern whether technology is serving human flourishing or eroding it. Let’s consider some key principles.\n1. Stewardship Over Creation God created humanity with dominion over nature (Genesis 1:26). This means humans have been entrusted with the responsibility to care for and develop God’s creation for good purposes. This principle encourages us to develop technology to enhance human life, such as medical innovations that save lives and improve health outcomes. However, technological advances should also serve to care for God's earth, not exploit it (Genesis 2:15).\n2. Love Neighbor As Ourselves (Matthew 22:39) In Christ-centered living, love is the primary moral compass directing us in how we interact with others. We should use technology not to harm or isolate others but to alleviate suffering and foster meaningful relationships. Examples could be video conference tools bringing families together despite distance constraints or assistive technologies enhancing communication for persons with disabilities.\n3. Respect For Human Dignity Human life is sacred because it bears the Imago Dei, the image of God (Genesis 1:27). Given this truth, the dignity and sanctity of human life must be preserved. Some technologies challenge this principle when they lead to increased human suffering or exploitation. For instance, weapons with devastating killing power can be developed without due consideration for the endangerment of innocent lives. Similarly, automation may replace human workers resulting in unemployment without appropriate provision for those afected.\n4. Wisdom In Discernment As followers of Christ, wisdom helps us discern when technological developments cross ethical boundaries. The book of Proverbs encourages us to walk “in the way of insight,” possessing sound judgment to distinguish right from wrong (Proverbs 4:14-15). For instance, cloning animals and humans seems ethically problematic since it attempts to manipulate God-given processes of life formation. The misuse of data collected through digital platforms may also cause serious privacy concerns and infringe upon personal freedom.\n5. Obedience To Government Authority (Romans 13:1-2) While remaining discerning about technology, we must obey laws established by duly appointed civil authorities within ethical bounds. These laws include regulation of technology usage to ensure safety, security, ad fairness for all citizens. As long as they adhere to biblical principles, Christians should cooperate with these rules and respect those in authority who make them.\nIn summary, by upholding principles of biblical stewardship, love for neighbors, respect for human dignity, wisdom in discernment, and obedience to governing authorities, Christians can responsibly navigate the realm of technological advancements.\nConclusion Ultimately, it is our attitude toward and impact on humanity and creation that defines the morality of our technological advancements. Christians must be mindful of the potential consequences and intentions behind each technology while holding onto God's wisdom and His unwavering standards in order to approach the inevitable technological progress faithfully. Remembering that technology is merely a tool, we are always responsible agents shaping our world for better or worse. So let us strive to ensure our creations reflect Christ's glory and serve His purposes.\n","wordCount":"590","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-12T11:01:00Z","dateModified":"2024-03-12T11:01:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/posts/63450194-how-should-christians-approach-progress-in-technology/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Christian Barnettre","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://christianbarnettre.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Christian Barnettre (Alt + H)">Christian Barnettre</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How Should Christians Approach Progress in Technology?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-12 11:01:00 +0000 UTC'>March 12, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Evaluating Technology Through Biblical Principles">Evaluating Technology Through Biblical Principles</a><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="1.

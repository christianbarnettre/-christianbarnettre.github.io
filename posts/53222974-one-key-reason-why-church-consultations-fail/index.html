These churches are already deeply wounded and in desperate need of spiritual healing; however, many leaders don't want to tackle the underlying issues blocking their congregation from experiencing true revival. As a result they bypass authentic spiritual transformation in favor of externally driven programs and schemes.\nThe willingness to undergo personal brokenness and surrender is crucial for genuine spiritual renewal. A true consultation seeks to identify systemic roots causing a church's decline, its subterranean fault lines, its unseen strongholds, and only then does it aim to craft a biblical blueprint for growth.\nMissing Foundation of True Renewal Many church leaders avoid going through deep soul searching and repentance because it means recognizing their failures in leadership, lack of devotion, or poor example setting. They mistakenly think that consulting firms are there solely to repair the church's external circumstances while overlooking their own spiritual health. But the absence of personal brokenness and surrender sets up a faulty foundation for any true spiritual renewal and results in a hollow shell of change that won't last.\nSadly, church consultations can easily become band-aid solutions if leaders don't confront their pride, greed, envy, lust for power among other sinful behaviors that have been overlooked and unexamined. These hidden issues must be tackled head on. Failing to face them will lead to empty attempts at fixing the symptoms rather than treating the root causes of spiritual sickness.\nConclusion As a church consultant, I urge congregational leaders to embrace personal brokenness and surrender for themselves as well as their respective churches. Such submission before God allows room for grace-driven spiritual healing and genuine renewal that provides long term restoration rather than temporary repair work. Remembering this essential truth when initiating a church consultation can make all the difference between true spiritual revival and a false hope of superficial change. It takes courage to face our weaknesses, but the rewards of humility far outweigh the costs of prideful stubbornness.\n","wordCount":"452","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-05T10:53:02Z","dateModified":"2024-03-05T10:53:02Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/posts/53222974-one-key-reason-why-church-consultations-fail/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Vaceslav Kanukov","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://christianbarnettre.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Vaceslav Kanukov (Alt + H)">Vaceslav Kanukov</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">One Key Reason Why Church Consultations Fail</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-05 10:53:02 +0000 UTC'>March 5, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Surrender Before Spiritual Revival">Surrender Before Spiritual Revival</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Missing Foundation of True Renewal">Missing Foundation of True Renewal</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>In consulting with churches I have become dismayed over the numerous attempts at revitalizing or rebuilding a congregation only to see them crash back into their old, unhealthy patterns.

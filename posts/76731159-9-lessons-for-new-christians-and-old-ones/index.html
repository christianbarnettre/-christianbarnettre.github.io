A Christian is any person who has personally accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. Their life is centered around God’s Son and what He accomplished through His life on earth. God offers forgiveness for sin—which separates us from Him—through believing in Jesus Christ.\nSo, the number one lesson is: To be a Christian means believing Jesus died for our sins, was buried, rose again, ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God as our Savior. Trusting in him alone gives us eternal life.\nDevotion to the Word of God 2) Reading the Bible is essential for every believer. The Bible is God’s Word written by inspired individuals throughout history. It communicates God’s truth about Himself, how we as humans should live in relationship with Him, and answers questions about God’s plans for the future. A heart set on obeying God will make every effort to know His Word better.\nBaptism Into Christ 3) When a person becomes a new Christian, they often go through baptism. Baptism symbolizes dying to your old way of living and rising again in Christ Jesus. This public declaration identifies the believer with Christ as Lord (Romans 6:1–7; Colossians 2:12).\nGathering Together Regularly 4) Christians encourage one another through regular meetings called church services. These gatherings provide opportunities to worship God corporately, learn from His Word being preached, share prayer requests with fellow believers, and support each other in love and practical ways (Hebrews 10:23-25).\nBeing a Good Steward of God's Grace 5) As Christians, we recognize God’s grace to us in saving our souls from eternal damnation. Out of gratitude, we desire to faithfully use whatever talents, time, money, relationships, etc., He has entrusted to us, always seeking to be good stewards (1 Peter 4:10).\nDisplaying Fruitfulness 6) Believing in Christ requires an active faith where we strive to grow spiritually as we connect more intimately with Him daily. God bears fruit through us as believers as we practice love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control (Galatians 5:22-23).\nResisting Spiritual Enemy Attacks 7) As a Christian, you are no longer a slave to Satan but have been made God’s child. However, Satan seeks to hurt believers and destroy their lives through temptations, discouragement, fearmongering, etc. Constant prayer and staying alert keeps us in tune with God’s protection and enables us to thwart the devil’s schemes (Ephesians 6:11-17).\nWitnessing to Others About Jesus 8) One important part of being a follower of Jesus Christ is sharing your faith with others as the Holy Spirit leads you. Evangelizing is simply telling others about the life-changing power of knowing Jesus Christ as your Savior from sin (Acts 1:8).\nLiving Forever With Christ in Heaven 9) Ultimately, faith in Christ results in eternal life with God in heaven when you die physically or return at Christ’s Second Coming. Christians believe in a literal Heaven and Hell, where believers spend eternity worshipping God while unbelievers endure torment apart from God’s presence (John 3:16; John 14:1-6).\nIn conclusion, walking close to Jesus Christ involves learning and applying these 9 lessons among others as we serve God and make disciples by His grace. Striving to grow and implement these principles will bring glory to Him and ensure our spiritual well-being.\nPhoto Credit © rawpixel on Unsplash\n","wordCount":"593","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-27T13:04:10Z","dateModified":"2024-02-27T13:04:10Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/posts/76731159-9-lessons-for-new-christians-and-old-ones/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Christian Barnettre","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://christianbarnettre.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Christian Barnettre (Alt + H)">Christian Barnettre</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">9 Lessons for New Christians ...

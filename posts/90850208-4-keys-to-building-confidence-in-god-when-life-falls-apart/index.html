Your heart longs to find a way back to confidence in God but it seems elusive right now. What can you do to regain that trust and renew your relationship with Him when life falls apart?\nBelow are four keys to help you build trust and confidence in God during dark times:\nRemember His truth Practice spiritual disciplines Open your heart and mind Connect with other believers As you go through these steps, God's presence will become more real to you, healing your wounds and restoring your faith.\n1. Remember His Truth The first step is to recall the fundamentals of your faith which serve as rock-solid foundations amidst life's storms. For example, God's eternal love for you (John 3:16), His desire to be by your side in everything (Deuteronomy 31:6), your privilege of approaching Him anytime through Jesus Christ (Hebrews 7:25), and promises of His abundant provision and protection (Psalm 91).\nThese truths lay a strong base for you to stand on while uncertainty brews around you. And even if you struggle to remember them, God's word remains steadfast, never changing—you can always go back to His Word to find comfort and solace.\n2. Practice Spiritual Disciplines Spiritual disciplines help you keep focused on your relationship with God despite challenges. These include prayer, meditation on Scripture, fasting, giving generously, serving others, and solitude. Regularly partaking in these practices fortifies your spiritual muscle and makes you less susceptible to doubt and fear.\nIn uncertain times, you may need to dig deeper into these routines than usual. If you don't have established disciplines yet, begin with simple actions such as praying each morning or evening, reflecting on Bible verses or reading Christian books for inspiration.\n3. Open Your Heart and Mind Throughout this journye of regaining trust in God, try your best not to give up, though feelings of disconnection from Him may linger. If you feel distant from Him or struggle with anger or bitterness against life situations, it's important to acknowledge these feelings rather than suppress them.\nShare your hurt with God in prayer—express your emotions honestly without feeling guilty. God understands your pain and meets you where you are. In time, as you humbly open your heart and mind to Him, your spirit will grow tender and sensitive to His guidance once again.\n4. Connect With Other Believers During challenging times, it becomes increasingly vital to surround yourself with fellow Christians who will offer support, empathize with your situation, pray with you, give wise counsel, and lift you up with their own stories of faith. Engage with Christian online communities or attend in-person fellowships (when safe) to create this support network.\nLeanibg on one another helps keep us all grounded. Sharing your troubles with like-minded individuals strengthens your faith, knowing that you are not alone in your walk with God.\nConclusion Regaining confidence in God when life falls apart can be a painful but ultimately rewarding process. By remembering His truths, practicing spiritual disciplines, opening your heart and mind to His presence, and connecting with other believers, you are likely to restore your trust in Him step by step.\nAs you embark on this journey of healing your faith, know that God walks this path alongside you every step of the way, eagerly wanting to rekindle your trust as you seek Him again.\n","wordCount":"584","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-08T08:04:27Z","dateModified":"2024-03-08T08:04:27Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/posts/90850208-4-keys-to-building-confidence-in-god-when-life-falls-apart/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Vaceslav Kanukov","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://christianbarnettre.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Vaceslav Kanukov (Alt + H)">Vaceslav Kanukov</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">4 Keys to Building Confidence in God When Life Falls Apart</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-08 08:04:27 +0000 UTC'>March 8, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="1.

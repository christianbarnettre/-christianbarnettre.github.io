Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, let us work for the good of all, and especially for those who belong to our family in faith.\"\nIn this article, we will discuss how Christians can genuinely follow Paul's directive and actually treat other believers as family.\nRecognize Every Christian as a Faith Brother or Sister To start treating other Christian believers as family members, it must begin with a conscious shift in perception. We need to see every fellow believer as a spiritual sibling rather than simply as acquaintances or casual friends. By recognizing Jesus Christ as the Head of the family of God (Ephesians 3:14-12), we are all joined together into one body irrespective of race, culture, age, or gender.\nPray Regularly for Fellow Brothers and Sisters Praying consistently for your fellow Christian brothers and sisters is one tangible way to cultivate familial affection for them. This entails praying for their needs, protection from evil forces, guidance towards holiness, and blessings in different aspects of their lives. By so doing, we are strengthening the bond which unites us together under Christ (Colossians 1:17).\nShare Your Resources Willingly with Them In the Bible, there are countless instances where Christians were called upon to show practical love to their brothers and sisters in the faith. The early church often shared its goods and resources freely to help feed hungry members and care for those struggling financially (Acts 2:42-47). In contemporary times, we can extend this practice by offering financial support to struggling Christians in our communities, giving generously during church offerings, or even providing emotional support when necessary.\nOffer Encouragement and Support When Struggling Christian brothers and sisters sometimes face difficulties in their walk with Christ. During such times, they need encouragement, prayers, fellowship, and counsel from others who share their faith. As a true family member in Christ, seek opportunities to provide this sort of help and be there during their challenging moments.\nHold Each Other Accountable for Spiritual Growth A family environment often comes with built-in accountability. Just as a father holds his son or daughter responsible for attending school, obeying curfew rules, etc., fellow Christians should be held responsible for growing spiritually and fulfilling their obligations towards God in obedience to his commands (Hebrews 3:12-13). This could involve regularly checking up on each other's spiritual well-being, being honest in sharing concerns about possible deviances from Christian values, or helping one another remain focused on godly practices.\nConclusion Following Paul's admonition from Galatians rdequires a deliberate choice to change our outlook regarding fellow Christian believers. By seeing them as our spiritual family, praying for them regularly, sharing our resources willingly with them, offering encouragement when needed, and holding one another spiritually accountable, we can develop authentic familial relationships among Christians that enrich our collective walk with God.\n","wordCount":"518","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-02-29T05:59:58Z","dateModified":"2024-02-29T05:59:58Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/posts/13125965-how-to-actually-treat-other-believers-like-family/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Vaceslav Kanukov","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://christianbarnettre.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Vaceslav Kanukov (Alt + H)">Vaceslav Kanukov</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">How to Actually Treat Other Believers Like Family</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-02-29 05:59:58 +0000 UTC'>February 29, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Recognize Every Christian as a Faith Brother or Sister">Recognize Every Christian as a Faith Brother or Sister</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Pray Regularly for Fellow Brothers and Sisters">Pray Regularly for Fellow Brothers and Sisters</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Share Your Resources Willingly with Them">Share Your Resources Willingly with Them</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Offer Encouragement and Support When Struggling">Offer Encouragement and Support When Struggling</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Hold Each Other Accountable for Spiritual Growth">Hold Each Other Accountable for Spiritual Growth</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>A passage from Paul's letter to the Galatians has often been used as a call to treat all fellow Christians like family members.

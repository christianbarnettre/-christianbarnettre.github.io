In this case, let's focus on understanding what Jesus teaches us concerning God's end times plan.\nParables on the Second Coming In several parables, Jesus offers insights into God's end times plan:\n1) The Parable of Ten Virgins (Matthew 25:1-13): This narrative illustrates the importance of staying awake spiritually and being prepared for Christ's return. The five wise virgins who had brought extra oil prepared themselves, whereas the foolish ones ran out and missed Christ's arrival.\n2) The Parable of the Fig Tree (Mark 13:28-29): Here, Jesus likens the fig tree sprouting leaves - representing signs indicating the nearness of His coming - to the \"end is near\" message about His second advent to earth.\n3) The Parable of the Faithful Servant (Luke 12:35-46): This story emphasizes the need to remain watchful and faithful in anticipation of the master's return, as seen when the thief breaks into the house but finds it protected against intrusion thanks to the servant's preparation.\nThese accounts collectively stress vigilance and preparedness against the unexpected arrival of Christ at the end of time.\nTeaching on Prophetic Signs Jesus spoke about indicators preceding His return in Matthew 24 and Mark 13. He mentioned false Christs, widespread wars, famines, earthquakes, increased lawlessness, persecution of believers, gospel preached worldwide, abomination that causes desolation, and great tribulation before His return and establishment of is kingdom on earth. These prophetic signs indicate the approach of God's divine intervention.\nResurrection and Judgment Message The message of Christ's resurrection intersects with thoughts on end times as well. In John 5:28-29, Jesus states unequivocally that those who sleep (die) will be raised up at the last day. This implies a resurrection event occurring coincidentally with or immediately before his anticipated return during the end times. Additionally, Christ reminds us in Matthew 16:27 regarding coming judgment when he says \"For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels...\" This signifies the future judgment associated with end-times events.\nConclusion Jesus offers a clear perspective about God's end-times plan. Primarily, He encourages believers to be spiritually ready and vigilant, highlighted by the various parables. The prophetic signs Jesus mentions serve as warnings of impending global distress prior to His return, promising resurrection of all mankind at a designated time. Finally, the concept of judgment connected with Christ's second coming further underscores the inevitability and consequential nature of these future events as taught by Himself.\n","wordCount":"450","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-03-02T08:18:11Z","dateModified":"2024-03-02T08:18:11Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/posts/36516282-what-does-jesus-teach-us-about-god-s-end-times-plan/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Christian Barnettre","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://christianbarnettre.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://christianbarnettre.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Christian Barnettre (Alt + H)">Christian Barnettre</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">What Does Jesus Teach Us about God's End-Times Plan?</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-03-02 08:18:11 +0000 UTC'>March 2, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=# aria-label="Parables on the Second Coming">Parables on the Second Coming</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Teaching on Prophetic Signs">Teaching on Prophetic Signs</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label="Resurrection and Judgment Message">Resurrection and Judgment Message</a></li><li><a href=# aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>When discussing various aspects of life, ranging from personal responsibilities to current events, we are often directed towards asking, "What does Jesus teach us?"
